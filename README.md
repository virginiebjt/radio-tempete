# radio-tempete
Play a webradio stream on a Raspberry Pi and print meta data on an OLED i2c screen

Hardware needed:
- Raspberry pi 3 or above (if you want bluetooth, otherwise any Raspberry will do)
- Micro SD card, min. 8go
- OLED display (the most common one is SSD1306, mine is SH1106), ex: https://www.ebay.fr/itm/1-3-White-OLED-LCD-Display-Module-IIC-I2C-Interface-128x64-3-5V-For-Arduino-/173560164703
- 4 dupont wire female to female (https://www.ebay.fr/itm/dupont-cable-liaison-pour-module-Arduino-male-ou-femelle-40-fils/171060862090?hash=item27d4059c8a:g:k6IAAMXQTT9Rv3uv&var=471169380327), usually comes with your oled display

We'll first stream the webradio to our device, and then set up the display.



## Play Radio TempÃªte on Raspberry Pi

Install Raspberry Pi OS (formely known as Raspbian) on your Raspberry Pi. Ideally, chose a desktop version for things to be easier. If you have a Raspberry Pi Zero, take Raspberry Pi Lite (without desktop version): you will have to do everything from the command line. Instructions here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

Connect your Raspberry Pi to a keyboard, mouse and screen, or control it with your computer with SSH and VNC https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/

Install Music Player Daemon. This will play any webradio stream. 
Run the following commands in your terminal
 
 `sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get upgrade
 sudo apt install mpc mpd`
 
 Add your radio stream, in this case: https://listen.radioking.com/radio/372772/stream/422929 by running this command
 `mpc add https://listen.radioking.com/radio/372772/stream/422929`
 
 And play it:
  `mpc play`
 
 If everything's working well you should hear the music!
